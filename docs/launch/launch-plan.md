# TradingClaude SMC Suite -- Launch Plan

> Version 1.0 | Date: 2026-02-12

---

## 1. Pre-Launch Activities (Week 7-8)

### Week 7: Build Anticipation

**TradingView Ideas (3-5 trade ideas using the indicator):**

Post trading ideas on TradingView using TC-SMC without naming it. The goal is to generate curiosity and establish credibility.

- Idea 1: Publish a long setup on BTC/USDT showing a confluence of OB + FVG + discount zone + HTF alignment. Caption: "Smart money concepts in action -- bullish confluence on BTC. More on the tool behind this analysis coming soon."
- Idea 2: Publish a EUR/USD trade idea highlighting a liquidity sweep into an order block. Caption: "SSL sweep into a bullish OB -- classic SMC setup. Indicator in development."
- Idea 3: Publish a swing trade idea on SPX or AAPL using HTF structure overlay. Caption: "HTF structure alignment with LTF entry -- multi-timeframe confluence."
- Idea 4: Publish a post-mortem analysis showing how TC-SMC detected a major reversal (CHoCH + sweep). Caption: "Change of Character detected -- the most important signal in market structure."
- Idea 5 (optional): Publish a "what would you do here" interactive idea showing a setup forming in real time.

**Screenshots with Watermark:**

Prepare 6-8 high-quality screenshots for launch materials:

1. Full chart with all modules active (overview shot)
2. Market Structure: BOS and CHoCH labels on a trending chart
3. Order Blocks: Unmitigated and mitigated OBs with clear labeling
4. Fair Value Gaps: Partial fill tracking in action (box shrinking)
5. Liquidity: BSL/SSL levels with a confirmed sweep
6. Dashboard close-up showing all rows populated
7. Multi-Timeframe: HTF OBs and structure overlaid on a LTF chart
8. Confluence: Multiple signals aligning at a key level

Each screenshot should have a subtle TradingClaude watermark or profile tag.

**Social Media Teasers (Twitter/X):**

Post 3-4 teaser tweets during week 7-8:

Tweet 1 (Week 7, Day 1):
```
Working on something for the SMC community.

7 modules. 1 indicator. Free.

Market structure, order blocks, FVGs, liquidity sweeps, premium/discount, multi-timeframe, and a real-time dashboard.

Coming to TradingView soon.
```

Tweet 2 (Week 7, Day 4):
```
What if you could see HTF order blocks and FVGs projected directly on your LTF chart?

Auto HTF detection. Anti-repainting verified. Confluence alerts when signals align.

```

Tweet 3 (Week 8, Day 1):

Liquidity sweeps are one of the most powerful SMC signals -- but no major free indicator detects them automatically.

Thread with details below.
```

Thread replies:
```
1/ MARKET STRUCTURE
Detects BOS and CHoCH at both internal and swing levels. CHoCH is the first structure break against the trend -- the most important reversal signal.

[Screenshot: BOS/CHoCH on chart]
```

```
2/ ORDER BLOCKS + FVGs
OBs are validated by confirmed structure breaks. No low-quality zones.
FVGs feature dynamic partial fill tracking -- boxes shrink as price fills the gap.

[Screenshot: OBs and FVGs]
```

```
3/ LIQUIDITY SWEEPS
Automatically detects when price wicks past BSL/SSL levels and closes back. This is the signal most free indicators miss.

[Screenshot: Sweep detection]
```

```
4/ MULTI-TIMEFRAME + DASHBOARD
HTF structure, OBs, and FVGs projected on your LTF chart. Auto HTF detection. Plus a real-time dashboard showing trend, structure, zones, liquidity, position, and confluence signals.

[Screenshot: MTF + Dashboard]
```

```
5/ CONFLUENCE DETECTION
When 2+ signals align on the same bar (e.g., OB touch + sweep + discount + HTF aligned), the indicator fires a confluence alert. This is the highest-probability signal.

## 4. Engagement Tactics

### TradingView

- **Respond to every comment** within 24 hours, aiming for <12 hours in week 1. Thank users by name. Address technical questions thoroughly.
- **Like and boost** every trade idea published by users that mentions TC-SMC.
- **Pin a FAQ comment** on the script page addressing the top questions.
- **Publish 2 trade ideas per week** using the indicator to keep the script visible in TradingView's feed.
- **Monitor for bug reports** daily. If a user reports an issue, acknowledge it immediately and provide a timeline for a fix.

### Twitter/X

- **Engage with SMC/ICT community** -- reply to popular SMC traders' posts with relevant TC-SMC analysis (without being spammy).
- **Use relevant hashtags**: #SmartMoney #SMC #ICT #TradingView #OrderBlocks #FVG #Liquidity
- **Quote-retweet** users who share their TC-SMC experience.
- **Run a "setup of the week"** thread each Friday featuring the best confluence setup from that week.

### Community Building

- Consider creating a Discord or Telegram group if demand reaches 50+ active users asking for community.
- Engage with TradingView's "Editors' Picks" community -- having a trade idea picked by TV editors drives significant traffic.
- Cross-promote with other indicator developers (non-competing) for mutual visibility.

## 7. Risk Mitigation

### Negative Feedback Response Plan

**If users report repainting:**
1. Acknowledge immediately: "Thank you for reporting this. Taking it very seriously."
2. Ask for specific details: asset, timeframe, what they observed.
3. Investigate within 24 hours using TradingView replay mode.
4. If confirmed: publish a patch within 48 hours. Communicate the fix publicly.
5. If not confirmed: explain the anti-repainting architecture with specific code references. Offer to walk through a replay test.

**If users report performance issues:**
1. Acknowledge and ask for their setup (TF, enabled modules, asset).
2. Suggest disabling non-essential modules as an immediate workaround.
3. If widespread: prioritize an optimization patch.

**If a competitor copies the approach:**
1. Do not engage publicly.
2. Continue publishing high-quality content and building community trust.
3. Focus on iterating faster with new features.

### Patch Release Process

For post-launch bug fixes:
1. Fix the issue in Pine Script.
2. Test on the 6 test assets (BTC, ETH, EUR/USD, GBP/JPY, AAPL, SPX) across 6 timeframes.
3. Update the script on TradingView.
4. Post a comment on the script page: "v1.x.x update: [brief description of fix]."
5. Reply to the user who reported the bug, thanking them and confirming the fix.
